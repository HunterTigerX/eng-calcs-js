Description
===========

Contains engineering calculators designed to be viewed with a browser.

Heat Flow Calculator
--------------------

Calculates power dissipation, thermal resistance, or temperature change, given the other two parameters. You can dynamically add more thermal components (having both a thermal resistance and temperature change) to the equation.

Standard Resistance Calculator
------------------------------

Given an input resistance, finds the closest resistance in a specified standard resistance series (an E series, e.g. E12 or E24).

LT3745 Calculator
-----------------

Calculates values of the supporting passive components for the LT3745 LED driver by Linear Technology. Uses equations given in the datasheet.

Internal Dependencies
=====================

None.

External Dependencies
=====================

MathJax (delivered through MathJax CDN) for latex rendering of equations.

knockout.js (delivered through CDN) for MVVM framework.

candy-calc 

Issues
======

See GitHub Issues.

Limitations
===========

None documented.

Usage
=====

This repo is designed so that you can clone it directly (using SSH) into a folder on the web server called ``public_html/lib/eng-calcs-js/``. Then using PHP on a web page (including Wordpress, if you have a plugin which allows php on a page), include the php file of the specific calculator you wish to use, e.g.

::

	include 'lib/eng-calcs-js/chip-specific/lt3745/lt3745.php';
	
The PHP file will automatically include it's respective Javascript file that resides in the same directory. All dependencies are automatically included via CDNs.

v3.10.1.0 2013-11-18 Added a namespace for the LT3745 calculator so that other calculators can run on the same page. This uses the knockout data-bind 'with' command.
v3.10.0.0 2013-11-18 Added 'IsNumber' validators to all inputs of the LT3745 calculator.
v3.9.0.0  2013-11-18 Replaced fugf with correct variable name. Added more comments to the LT3745 calculator.
v3.8.5.0  2013-11-18 Removed all commented calculator code which is now in candy-calc. Updated candy-calc API calls to match new cc namespace (using cc.input and cc.output).

v3.8.0.0  2013-11-14 LT3745 calculator now calls candy-calc framework (code moved into candy-calc repo).
v3.7.7.0  2013-11-12 Replaced all occurrences of $ with jQuery.
v3.7.6.0  2013-11-12 Changed $ to jQuery to see if it will fix jQuery issues when running in Wordpress.
v3.7.5.0  2013-11-12 Modified incorrect conditional jQuery load.
v3.7.4.0  2013-11-12 Added check to see if jQuery has already been loaded before loading (conditional load) to avoid conflicts when running on Wordpress.
v3.7.3.0  2013-11-12 Added a forward-slash to the front of the candy-calc CSS path to see if it will fix the 'resource not found' error.
v3.7.2.0  2013-11-12 Moved more of the inline styles into the candy-calc repo.
v3.7.1.0  2013-11-11 Moved CSS code into candy-calc repo and added link to it from lt3445.php file. Aim is to eventually move all 'calculator framework' code into the candy-calc repo, while leaving Js-EngCalcs for actual calculator implementations.
v3.7.0.0  2013-11-11 Added glow to currently selected input box. Moved input/output background colour styling to CSS, and made input border reflect background colour.
v3.6.3.0  2013-11-11 Added validator array support for computed variables. Changed outputs from disabled to readonly, which still allows tooltips to be displayed.
v3.6.2.0  2013-11-11 Made tooltips red to look like errors. Tooltips now display errors message associated with failed validator. Had to create a new qTip everytime I wanted to change the text as the content text change code didn't work properly.
v3.6.1.0  2013-11-10 Upgraded the tooltip styling (made it black with rounded corners). Began working on validator array functionality, in where multiple validators can be added for a single calculator variable. These are then automatically ran everytime the variable changes, and the red/green status and tooltip updated accordingly.
v3.6.0.0  2013-11-10 Add qTip (jQuery tooltip library), and implemented basic tooltip functionality on non-valid inputs/outputs.
v3.5.6.0  2013-11-10 Fixed the too-large 'Comments' column by add all cells in this column to the 'comment' class, and then applying 'text-size: small' to this class using CSS.

v3.5.4.0  2013-11-09 Removed all spaces from standard resistance finder and heat flow calculator folder names.
v3.5.3.0  2013-11-08 Changed the table width from 90% width to 1000px because it was being rendered too small in the web page.
v3.5.2.0  2013-11-08 Replaced inline styles with class parameter and CSS class selectors at top of page for the LT3745 calculator.
v3.5.1.0  2013-11-08 Changed all variables to use the calc object in the LT3745 calculator.
v3.5.0.0  2013-11-07 Fixed calculator object code bugs in the LT3745 calculator. The calc object now works fine, making it easier to created input and calculated variables which bind to the markup. One issue remaining is that the validator function has to be assigned after the object is created, not as part of the constructor.
v3.4.4.0  2013-11-05 Working on a validator for computed variables, along with rounding capabilities.
v3.4.3.0  2013-11-05 Validator has now been applied to two observable variables. Have to work on computed variables next.
v3.4.2.0  2013-11-05 Validator is now implemented with a function assigned to the validator variable. Still only testing with one variable in the LT3745 calculator.
v3.4.1.0  2013-11-04 Improved custom binding for fsw(act) with automatic colour changes on invalid value.
v3.4.0.0  2013-11-04 Basic custom binding working for fsw(act). Full functionality has not yet been added.

v3.2.0.0  2013-11-03 Added comments column to calculator table, and populated some of the comment cells. Added 'brief' doxygen comments to lt3745.php and lt3745.js. Removed old code from a previous calculator in lt3745.js. Add style rule so that calculator is 90% of the width of the parent element.
v3.1.0.0  2013-11-02 Added more variables to the LT3745 calculator. Now finds maximum switching frequency, minimum output capacitance, minimum inductance, and minimum input capacitance.
v3.0.0.0  2013-11-01 Added calculator for LT3745 LED driver under chip-specific/lt3745. Calculates values for supporting passive components, based on equations given in the datasheet. Added relevant info to the datasheet.

v2.2.7.0  2013-10-07 Fixed NaN bug when desired resistance was above highest number in series, by adding the first number in the next order of magnitude to the end of the series arrays. Re-included jQuery, as I discovered it is needed for these scripts.
v2.2.6.0  2013-10-07 Removed jQuery include in standard resistance calculator, as not needed, and was causing issues with the Wordpress MegaMenu.
v2.2.5.2  2013-10-07 Added title block to php files. Added comments to php files.
v2.2.5.1  2013-10-07 Changed incorrect standard-resistance-calculator.c extension in title block to .js.
v2.2.5.0  2013-10-07 Set debug to false in the standard resistance calculator Javascript file.
v2.2.4.0  2013-10-07 Added backslashes to the start/end in the preg pattern, also escaped a forward slash. 
v2.2.3.0  2013-10-07 Formatted __FILE__ so remove leading public_html (and beforehand) parts to URL. 
v2.2.2.0  2013-10-07 Made standard resistor php file load JS script with realpath(dirname(__FILE__)), which should give the correct path no matter where php file is included from.
